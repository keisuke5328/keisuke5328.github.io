                For the research project to produce a software for collision awareness for unmanned aerial systems, I created several unit tests for
                the SDK developed in University of Washington. The conference paper of the project result was published. For another project, I constructed
                the camera systems for University of Washington Unmanned Aerial Systems which sends images remotely from a camera to a receiver connected to a computer for
                the image analysis.
                I also modified a ground station software(Mission Planner) code to develop a custom functionality for the research purpose, which was to save the sensor information
                to a file as UAVs fly.
